# TheOS

This is a hobby OS that I wrote in C.

It's mainly the product of several tutorials found on the [OSDev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org). However there are some other customizations that I wrote myself.

I stopped working on this project right around the time that I started implementing virtual memory.
